            <h2>US vs Russia: How to Reach Truce in Syria</h2>                
                <p>In the Kremlin in Moscow, on July 14, 2016 President Vladimir Putin (L) and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shake hands during their meeting there.</p>
                <p>At a news conference alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Kerry identified two problems that have damaged an internationally-brokered ceasefire in Syria: attacks carried out by the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, and what Kerry described as indiscriminate bombing by Assad's forces.</p>
                <p>The vast majority of U.S. airstrikes in Syria have been targeted against ISIS while U.S. officials have repeatedly accused Russian Federation and its close ally Syria of largely striking opposition forces, some of which are backed by the U.S. Kerry said last month that reaching an understanding with Russian Federation was "the most important thing" in ending the bloodshed in Syria. Russia hasn't hesitated. As Russia has taken out Nusra forces, the USA says Russia also has killed hundreds of moderate, anti-Assad fighters and civilians, undermining chances for peaceful diplomacy.</p>
                <p>"The conversation was a continuation of the constructive, frank and detailed dialogue", said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.</p>
                <p>Saudi Arabia warned Thursday that any military cooperation between the United States and Russian Federation in Syria must help advance a political transition to end the war without Bashar al-Assad in power.</p>
                <p>Suggestions of USA force don't carry much weight, given the unfulfilled threats throughout the war.</p>
                <p>It said strikes against those targets could be carried out by USA or Russian jets and expanded coordination would be channelled through a Joint Implementation Group based in the vicinity of the Jordanian capital, Amman.</p>
                <p>The United States and Russian Federation would establish separate headquarters for the operation and a shared coordination office, where they would deploy senior officials, intelligence personnel and experts in strike planning and targeting.</p>
                <p>They would decide on a date to simultaneously begin strikes against Nusra Front targets and to stop all Syrian military air activities in designated areas, except for non-combat purposes and against areas where Nusra Front has acquired territory.</p>
                <p>The proposal allows for Syrian military air activities against al Nusra outside the designated areas if Nusra acquires territory there. Russia hasn't hesitated. As Russia has taken out Nusra forces, the USA says Russia also has killed hundreds of moderate, anti-Assad fighters and civilians, undermining chances for peaceful diplomacy.</p>
                <p>In conclusion of the part of talks open for the press, Putin said: "President Obama drew my attention to the fact that Russian Federation helped release one of the American citizens [in Syria]". Moscow backs President Bashar al-Assad, who Washington and its allies say must step down.</p>
                <p>Kerry declined to comment when asked about the document before leaving for Moscow.</p>
                <p>But a Kremlin spokesman said that Putin and Kerry had not directly discussed military cooperation between Moscow and Washington in Syria.</p>
                <p>The U.S. still wants to see Assad encouraged to leave, although U.S. officials can't really say how that is more than a hope. The second, on Tuesday, killed at least 12 rebel fighters at a nearby base, they said.</p>
                <p>The arrangement has troubled Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who has largely opposed the proposal, and defense sources have raised questions about the benefits that would accrue to Russian Federation under the deal and whether Moscow would keep its commitments.</p>
                <p>That has raised fears that disagreements could escalate into confrontations, either accidental in Syria or the result of miscalculations in the air and naval encounters elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Even some of Kerry's own State Department subordinates question why he is trying to move forward, when U.S. -Russian relations are slipping backward.</p>
